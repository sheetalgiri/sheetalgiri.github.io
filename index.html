	<h1>Background</h1>
 	<p>Misconceptions about antibiotic use among community members potentially lead to inappropriate use of antibiotics in the community. Irrational antibiotic use has led society to antibiotic resistance—a serious health problem worldwide, which is now trying to be solved by many various approaches. In 2011, the World Health Day theme was “Combat drug resistance: no action today means no cure tomorrow” and for this occasion the World Health Organization introduced a six-point policy package to fight against the spread of antimicrobial resistance. This reflects the importance of the problem and the need to undertake some serious actions in all population groups, involved in the growth of antimicrobial resistance and irrational antibiotic use. </p>
 	<br>
	<p>Another critical misuse of antibiotic happens during self-medication, which is defined as the acquisition of antibiotics and self-administering them (or administering them to children) with the aim of treating perceived infection.</p> 
 	<br>
	<h1>Objectives</h1>
	<p>The objectives of the study were to investigate the level of knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding antibiotics of the community people.An additional goal was the highlighting of situations in which people use antibiotics and the frequency of use of antibiotics, compared to natural methods of treatment. </p>
